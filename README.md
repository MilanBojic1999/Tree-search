# Tree-search
Visualisation of some serch algorithms with tree graph 
Number of graphs is defined:
  -Two graphs with number as there nodes
  -One binary tree with number as there nodes
  -Two graphs with Threedices state as there nodes and with defined heuristic function
  -One graph with MisionarsAndCannibals state as there nodes and with defined heuristic function
Implemented search algorithms:
  -DepthFirstSearch
  -Breadth FirstSearch
  -IterableDeepening Search
  -Bidirectional BreadthFirst Search
  -GlobalHillClimbing Search
  -BestFirst Search
  -A* Search
